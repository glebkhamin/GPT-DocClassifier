# AI Document Processor

## Project Overview

This repository contains the AI Document Processor, an advanced machine learning solution designed to automate the extraction, chunking, and tagging of textual content from a variety of document formats. Built with the cutting-edge capabilities of GPT APIs, this system streamlines the organisation and categorisation of large volumes of documents, making it an invaluable tool for content management and data analysis tasks.

## Features
- #### Document Chunking: Breaks down various document types into manageable text chunks for easier processing.
- Intelligent Tagging: Utilizes a fine-tuned GPT model to intelligently tag text chunks based on content relevance.
- Multi-format Compatibility: Processes a range of document formats including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX.
- Content Interpretation: Capable of interpreting and tagging not only text but also the contents of images and tables within documents.
- GPT-4 Vision Integration: Leverages GPT-4-Vision for advanced image and table understanding within documents.
- CSV Compilation: Aggregates all chunks and tags into a comprehensive CSV file for subsequent use.
