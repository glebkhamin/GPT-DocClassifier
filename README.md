# GPT-DocClassifier

## Project Overview

This repository contains the GPT-DocClassifier, a machine learning solution designed to automate the chunking and tagging of various document types, including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX. Built with the cutting-edge capabilities of GPT APIs, this system streamlines the organisation and categorisation of large volumes of documents, making it an invaluable tool for content management and data analysis tasks.

## Features
- **Document Chunking:** Breaks down various document types into manageable text chunks for easier processing.
- **Intelligent Tagging:** Utilizes a fine-tuned GPT model to intelligently tag text chunks based on content relevance.
- **Multi-format Compatibility:** Processes a range of document formats including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX.
- **Content Interpretation:** Capable of interpreting and tagging not only text but also the contents of images and tables within documents.
- **GPT-4 Vision Integration:** Leverages GPT-4-Vision for advanced image and table understanding within documents.
- **CSV Compilation:** Aggregates all chunks and tags into a comprehensive CSV file for subsequent use.
