At the end of this prompt is a chunk of TEXT.
What TOPIC keywords are relevant to that chunk of TEXT?
You may return at most {{max_topic_count}} relevant topics, and you must assign at least one topic.
But do not attempt to always assign {{max_topic_count}} topics.
Do not make any comments about the results.
REMEMBER: Do not make any comments about the results outside of JSON format!
IMPORTANT: Always assign at least one topic.
Return the output in the following JSON form, ensuring it is compatible with Python eval():
{'topics': [topic0, topic1, ...]}
where each topic is a string.
Here is your chunk of TEXT:
{{text_chunk}}
